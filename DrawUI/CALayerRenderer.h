/// CALayerRenderer provides vector inked strokes with rasterized eraser strokes. Ink is drawn with
/// CAShapeLayers, and the eraser is rendered by a mask on those inked layers. Each time a
/// ink/eraser is toggled, a new layer and mask is created. All neighboring eraser strokes share the same
/// mask layer which saves some memory.
///
/// There are two ways to render eraser strokes: cached or realtime. A cached eraser will cache
/// the mask to a bitmap context so that each additional eraser stroke will be drawn in constant time.
/// A realtime eraser will redraw all eraser paths in the affected area.
///
/// The benefit of a realtime eraser is that it can render a predicted path for the eraser, and then update
/// the path correctly, while the cached eraser will draw faster but will not be able to benefit from predicted touches
